_UV Tools Guide_ is a reference card for creating content in Université Virtuelle (UV), official e-learning plateform of ULB (Université libre de Bruxelles). L'UV is based on [Moodle][moodle], version 4. Designed for teachers, educators and trainers, it provides info about Moodle ressources and activities and what tool to use according to the pedagogical goal to achieve. It also mentions the [Bloom taxonomic levels][bloom] that can be reached when using the different tools.
